    "4. using conditionals compare method 1 and 3 above. to determine the winner or loser\n",

    "general Algorithm \n",
    "1. Display rules to player \n",

    "4. If amt is less than 50 or greater than 1000, tell player to enter amt specified by the rules.\n",
    "5. If amt is within range, generate a four digit random number \n",
    "6. Ensure random number is generated such that the probability for a win for  1000 naira stake is 1 in 200 or 0.5%. For stakes lower than 1000, generate random number based on adjusted probability for the amt staked. \n",

    "1. Always use algorithms: ensure you understand the problem and state your algorithm clearly. shortens the programming time curve and makes problem solving easy.\n",
    "2. Do your research. when you are about to start a project, especially one of an unfamiliar subject matter. ensure to research and understand the problem\n",

    "4. Overall, the project has boosted my understanding and application of basic python concepts."
